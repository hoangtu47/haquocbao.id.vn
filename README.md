# Structure

Follows **Microservice** architecture. This whole application is a **collection of services** that are **independently deployable** and **loosely coupled**. 

- The service serving as the frontend and that of the backend are **separate** into two repositories, having its own **independent** and **asynchronous** CD/CI workflow. 
- Those two services are coupled through only **a single WebSocket connection**.
